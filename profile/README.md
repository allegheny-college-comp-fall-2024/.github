## `CMPSC 600`

Independent research in computer science culminating in the development of prototype or early draft of a computational artifact. Must be taken on a letter-grade basis. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

### Learning Outcomes

- Develop a viable and appropriate proposal for an independent and open-source research project.
- Describe a research process, its methods, and outcomes in writing in the form of an incremental research notebook and two chapters of a formal thesis document.
- Present and communicate complex ideas in a variety of media through both informal discussions, peer reviews and formal presentations.
- Produce and document a working prototype of computational artifact.
- Evaluate the produced prototype and reflect on theoretical, practical, ethical and social impact of the proposed artifact.
- Produce an original project that includes integration of theory and practice or software and hardware.

## `DS 600`

Independent research in data science culminating in the development of a prototype or early draft of a computational artifact. Must be taken  on a letter-grade basis. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.
